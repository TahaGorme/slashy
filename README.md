# Configs

Some money making configs.

### Balance Increaser

This config will focus more on your balance. This will increase your balance and net worth. [RECOMMENDED]

```json
	"commands": [
		"beg",
		"postmemes",
		"highlow",
		"fish",
		"hunt",
		"dig",
		"trivia",
		"stream"
	],
	"autoBuyItems": [
		"Life Saver"
	],
```
