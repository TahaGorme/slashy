# Installation

Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)


Run the following commands in your shell/console:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/TahaGorme/slashy.git
```

```javascript
cd slashy
```

```bash
npm i
```

- Now make a copy of [config.json.example](./config.json.example) and name it [config.json](./config.json), then, enter your details in it.


To start the selfbot, run the following command in your shell/console:
```javascript
node .
```


### Replit Deploy
[Fork this](https://replit.com/@TahaGorme/slashy?v=1)

- For replit, create a so called "secret" named "JSON" and put your config.json data in there. Now, the selfbot will automatically use this config.

## Batch File Format
- If you want to use this, create a file called "batch_token.cfg"
```js
channelId1 token1 // Use a single space to seperate the two values
channelId2 token2
```

- Set `isBatchTokenFile` to `true` in config file to enable the batch file ( tokens:{} will be ignored )

- For **Replit**, create a new secret and name it "**TOKENS**". Now, copy the contents of your batch file and paste them here.

## Config
```json
{
	"isBatchTokenFile": false, // WILL USE batch_token.cfg FOR TOKENS IF SET AS "TRUE"
